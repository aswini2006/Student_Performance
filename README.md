**Student Performance Analysis with Machine Learning Models**

**📌 Project Overview**

This project is designed to predict student math scores based on various features using multiple machine learning models. It includes:
- Data preprocessing (handling categorical and numerical variables).
- Training multiple regression models.
- Evaluating performance using metrics like R², Mean Absolute Error, and Root Mean Squared Error.
- Visualizations to understand predictions and actual data.

**🚀 Features**

- Supports preprocessing of categorical and numerical variables using OneHotEncoder and StandardScaler.
- Implementation of various regression models:- Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression
- KNeighbors Regressor
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Evaluation metrics include:- R² Score
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
